They were actually pretty good, maybe a little over stuffed on some but for the most part good. The only thing is that I didn't know which was which when I got my order. (As in it wasn't labeled) not a huge deal but I just wanted to be able to tell which one was the rice mesa pupusa. Overall, just eating 2 got me stuffed. They're not bad reheated but like anything else, they're better when fresh.\n",

I ordered the bangsilog and hot dang, it was fried to perfection. Achara (pickled papaya), cucumber slices and tomato slices were served with a side of garlic rice. If you're missing home, just grab your wallet and head over here! They also have kaldareta na kambing guys!.\n",
